# ShoppingList
Users can export/import shopping lists and keep track of the remaining items during shopping

**Usage**   
Create the shopping list on the editor page. As you're walking the aisle grabbing your groceries simply tap on the item that you've just taken from the shelf to remove it from the list.
Furthermore, you can also share the shopping list with e.g. your partner who can import this list and either overwrite or merge with their list.
